## NLP Machine Learning Researcher 

I am a final year student studying Physics in NTU doing Machine Learning research, with a primary focus on NLP and Event Extraction. I enjoy creating end-to-end ML models using different deep learning architectures to tackle a variety of tasks. I have used LSTMs, Transformers, CRFs and BERT language models for tackling the task of Document-level Event Extraction, where I managed to achieve state-of-the-art results for Document-level Event Extraction task. 

My interest lies in the Transformers architecture, as well as using ML models for real-world applications. This page consists of my previous works and projects.
