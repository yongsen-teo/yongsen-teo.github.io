## NLP Machine Learning Researcher 

I am a final year student studying Physics in NTU doing Machine Learning (ML) research, with a primary focus on Natural Language Processing and Event Extraction. I have just completed my Final Year Project on Document-level Event Extraction (collaboration with ASTAR I2R and NTU). Previously, I was a Summer Research Intern under the ASTAR Research Internship Award (ARIA) and worked on Event Extraction research in the Institute of Infocomm Research.  

I enjoy creating end-to-end ML models using different deep learning architectures to tackle a variety of tasks. I have used LSTMs, Transformers, CRFs and BERT language models for tackling Event Extraction, where I managed to achieve state-of-the-art results for the Document-level Event Extraction task. 

My interest lies in the Transformers architecture, as well as using ML models for real-world applications. This page consists of my previous works and projects.
